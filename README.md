# Infected-Cells
Classifying infected vs. uninfected malaria cells.
I used a small cnn when I went for the larger one it usually did not train as well. 
Also I started with a larger learning rate for 20 epochs then slowly decreased it. 
# Installing 
I used this kaggle dataset https://www.kaggle.com/iarunava/cell-images-for-detecting-malaria.
Requirements are Pytorch and Numpy
